You can use React Native's built-in command line interface to generate a new project. Let's create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

Enter the following commndas 
                     
        npx react-native init AwesomeProject
        cd /AwesomeProject 
        npx run-android or npx react-native run-android (to run the android app)
        npx run-ios or npx react-native run-ios (to run the ios app)

### Android permission Access and Camera Depedence Importing 

In you Project you should add these two  "VIBRATION , CAMERA"  permission to your AndroidManifest.xml. Its found in you Project path 
         
	                           PATH : android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml 
                                   
                                    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
                                    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>



You need to add the "missingDimensionStrategy" config for the 'react-native-camera' setting to 'general', this should be found in your android/app/build.gradle add the following:


                                    android {
                                         ...
                                     defaultConfig {
                                                ...
                                           missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general'
                                            }
                                      }
